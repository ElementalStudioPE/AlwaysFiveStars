                      <b>Response Recommendation:</b>  
                      <br><br>
                      1. First put yourself in the customer’s shoes as you read his/her comments, UNDERSTAND what he or she is trying to say (even if you don’t agree). You will use this to compose your response.
                      <br><br>
                      2. If you feel yourself getting emotional; stop and come back later.
                      <br><br>
                      3. No matter what you think is the truth of the situation, decide, if you were this customer, what would you like to happen?
                      <br><br>
                      4. Now given this situation, what’s one thing your business could do differently so that it is less likely to happen again? IF you can’t come up with ideas, speak with a trusted colleague.
